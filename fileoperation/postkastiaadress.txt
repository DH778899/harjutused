If ever words were spoken painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life, all I wanted was the keeping of someone like you
As it turns out, deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you

[Pre-Chorus]
Never-ending pain
Quickly ending life

[Chorus]
You keep this love (Thing), love (Child), love (Toy)
You keep this love (Fist), love (Scar), love (Break)
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love

[Verse 2]
I'd been the tempting one, stole her from herself
This gift in pain, her pain was life
And sometimes, I feel so sorry
I regret this, the hurting of you
But you made me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd kill myself for you
I'd kill you for myself

[Chorus]
You keep this love (Thing), love (Child), love (Toy)
You keep this love (Fist), love (Scar), love (Break)
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
No more head trips
Oh (No)

[Instrumental Break]

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You keep this love (Thing), love (Child), love (Toy)
You keep this love (Fist), love (Scar), love (Break)
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, oh
[Post-Chorus]
You keep this love
You keep this love
You keep this love
You keep this love, oh-oh
Hope
